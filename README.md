Managing 
- two github.com accounts with two tokens
- on the same MacOS 
- using the same protocol HTTPS

is a huge pain unless 

you configure:

```
[credential]
        helper = osxkeychain
        useHttpPath = true
```

in your `~/.gitconfig` file as mentioned in this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31351359/how-to-log-out-of-one-github-account-and-use-another-account/31351376#31351376)
